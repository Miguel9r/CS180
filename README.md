# CS180 Project

This is our Software Engineering Project for CS 180 at UCR.  First off, you want to ensure that you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed.  

After cloning the repo you should run the following commands:

```bash
cd ./cs180-app/
npm i nodemon -g
yarn
```

To run the entire application simply run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server is listening on Port 5000 and the client is running on Port 3000.  Once you run the above yarn command, you can go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check out the web app.
