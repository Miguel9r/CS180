# CS180 Project

This is our Software Engineering Project for CS 180 at UCR.  First off, you want to ensure that you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed.  

After cloning the repo you should run the following commands:

```bash
cd ./cs180-app/
npm i nodemon -g
yarn
cd ./client/
npm install
```

If you run into an error message try deleting the node_modules folder inside of the client folder and re-running the npm install command. To run the entire application simply run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server is listening on Port 5000 and the client is running on Port 3000.  Once you run the above yarn command, you can go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to check out the web app.

# Agile development

This project's development process will follow Scrum's development guidelines and techniques.
To keep an interactive task board accessible by all members of the team we are using Azure DevOps.

As well, we will keep a screenshot of the task board for each sprint finish in the folders Task Boards.
